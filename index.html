                <p>I love developing projects from scratch.<br>
                I particularize in simple and responsive web design solutions, and for now I have focused on how far you can take caching a website on a mobile to make a fully responsible, cross-platform multipurpose application with a lot of functionalities.<br>
                A fan of pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript, as well as Java, C# and Python. 
                Apart from my passion, I enjoy to surf the web, play video games and listen to music.</p>

                                        <p>I was born in Poland, came to the UK in 2013 and speak fluent Polish. I am a
                                                Distinction student who is self-motivated and who always goes towards
                                                completing goals and dreams, in addition to that I have excellent

                                                2017. That could prove that I am not playing around, and that not much
                                                can get on my way to stop me from getting to whatever my objective is.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>I am interested in becoming a Web Developer or a Software Engineer; so far I
                                                got a chance to create and design interactive and really responsive
                                                websites. I enjoy using technology when I am studying and in my free
                                                time, as it’s really relaxing, educational and helpful. Why do I think
                                                that I am suitable for work in IT industry? That’s very simple; I have
                                                experience with some computing areas; I have had lots of practice on
                                                program creating using C#, website building using pure HTML & CSS plus
                                                JavaScript and working with bitmap and vector graphics using programs
                                                like GIMP and Inkscape.</p>
                                        <p>From a young age I have wanted to create video games. I played around with
                                                Adobe Flash allowing me to create my first projects like games and
                                                animations. I continued with it until 2015 when I moved to a little
                                                something more interesting and advanced. AutoIT - a programming language
                                                allowing you to create a program that would be automated to do things
                                                for you. In 2016 I started studying at college and got to know the
                                                basics of C#, creating simple programs and games, as well as basic HTML
                                                which pushed me towards learning more about it and eventually creating
                                                my own websites from scratch using my own CSS and JS libraries which I
                                                have been producing at home. </p>
                                        <p>Digital INnov8tors allowed me to attend business meetings where people wanted
                                                to put their ideas into reality and had a chance to even work on one,
                                                called “Adventures in Bodiwell”, a phone application based on the book
                                                allowing children to learn about different internal body parts. In
                                                September 2018 I was chosen to attend an OPG Hack Day with Digital
                                                INnov8ors, to get the idea of what meetings and working on the projects
                                                look like as well as participating in it and talking to many different
                                                people who are working in different computing fields, asking them
                                                different questions about their jobs which would help me decide what I
                                                want to do. After that I took off and decided to be more independent and
                                                get myself into these type of project on my own. </p>
