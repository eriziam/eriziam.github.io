                <p>Currently studying Computer Science at <a href="https://aston.ac.uk">Aston University</a> in Birmingham, UK.<p>
                <p>I love developing projects from scratch, and working on things that are interesting, as well as time consuming. I particularize in simple and responsive web design solutions. A fan of pure HTML, CSS & JS, as well as Java, C# and Python. Apart from my passion, I enjoy to surf the web, chat with people, play video games and listen to music.</p>
